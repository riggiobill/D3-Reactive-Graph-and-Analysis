          <h2>Correlations Discovered Between Percentage of Poverty and Lack of Healthcare</h2>
          <p>The above data displays the relationship between a state's poverty level and 
            the same state's percentage of citizens without healthcare. The data has been extracted
            using D3 and represented above in a scatter plot for your convenience.
          </p>

          <p>An immediate relationship is seen to be present when the viewer observes the trends represented
            above. The clearest connection between the data seems to also be the most obvious:
            in states where the poverty level is higher, there is a generally larger lack of
            adequate healthcare.
          </p>

          <p>This makes sense upon consideration - the poverty level in an area can often indicate 
            the kind of jobs and income levels that will be present, and these both have a clear and
            immediate impact on availability of healthcare and funds with which to pay for it. Considering
            how impoverished individuals will need more medical care because of environmental pressures and 
            local risk factors, this will be a huge problem that makes itself worse over time.
